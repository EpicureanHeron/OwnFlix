1. Intro 
    - Basic Introduction 
        Initilly we looked at creating a platform that helped solve a probem for an existing area.
        little free library has a great decentralized groundswell of users. But if you;ve ever checked out a library you'll realize that no one knows what is in each box.
        Could we create a platform that helped catalog those books.  Could the box owner or users scan the barcode of a book with their phone.
        unformtunatly we quickly relized that the people behind the website want nothing to do with it, no api, no real data and poor website.  So other work to be done there first.
    - What is the problem
        Could we do this as an MVP with somethign else that we all have in our homes, movies.
