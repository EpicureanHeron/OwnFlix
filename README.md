## Introduction    

### About.   
Think "little Free Library" meets Netflix.  Many individuals like to buy movies on DVD and Blue ray. However, after the first few viewings those same movies just collect dust on the living room bookshelf. The idea behind OWNFLIX is to provide a platform to allow movie owners to connect and share.   

### Target Audience?    
Movie lovers who are also interested in sharing with their local community.   

### What is the problem to address.   
Communication and coordination between movie owners.   

### What is the primary goal of the product.    
Demonstration of an online website to coordinate DVD sharing similar to the "Little Free Library"

Movie information is provided through themoviedb API.  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction   

### Libraries
